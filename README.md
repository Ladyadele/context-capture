*Bridging the gap between hearing and understanding.*

## The Story Behind Context Capture

Auto-captions were meant to make meetings inclusive.  
But for millions of people with hearing disabilities, they often do the opposite.

Captions flicker, vanish, or miss half the words, leaving users lost mid-sentence.  
Important ideas get misheard. Jokes land flat. Conversations move on before understanding can catch up.  

That’s where **Context Capture** comes in; a tool designed not just to *hear*, but to *understand*.

---

## What Is Context Capture?

**Context Capture** is a web-based live transcription companion for video calls.  
It listens, learns, and displays everything being said *clearly, accurately, and in real time.*

It doesn’t just show what was said; it helps you *make sense* of it.  
Think of it as your meeting’s live, intelligent notetaker, built for everyone.

## Why It Matters

Every day, people join meetings and feel left out of the conversation because of poor caption quality or disappearing transcripts.  
They can’t replay what was missed, and most tools only provide summaries *after* the meeting ends.

**Context Capture** changes that.  
It brings empathy into technology, ensuring that inclusion isn’t an afterthought, but a built-in experience.

This tool exists so that:
- Deaf and hard-of-hearing participants can follow every word effortlessly.  
- Non-native speakers can better grasp context and unfamiliar phrases.  
- Teams can reference what was said — not just what they *think* was said.

In short: **everyone gets to stay in the conversation.**
No downloads, no plug-ins,  just open your browser and join understanding.
